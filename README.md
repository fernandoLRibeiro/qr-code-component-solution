## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the syntax for the CSS box-shadow property and that I should've written this README while I was building this project, because I've forgotten most of how the process of building this went. It was pretty good CSS practice though.

### Continued development

I need to get better at box-shadows. I haven't really used them at all before doing these Frontend Mentor challenges, so I never got to pratice enough to learn how to use them properly.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs article on box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me learn the syntax for the CSS box-shadow property.
